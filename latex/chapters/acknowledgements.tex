\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

We would like to thank Bruno Woltzenlogel for the extensive supervision and support he provided.
First as a mentor in the Google Summer of Code 2013, then as a supervisor of this thesis, he was always very supportive and provided help in questions of scientific practice, theory, implementation and all the other small issues that arose on the path to this thesis.

We would like to thank Robert Nieuwenhuis and Ashish Tiwari for answering questions about the short explanation decision problem and providing inspiration for the proof of its NP-completeness. Furthermore, we would like to thank Armin Biere for clarifying why resolution chains are not left-associative in the TraceCheck proof format. 

We also want to give credit to the website stackexchange.com, its children sites and all its contributors. Without this website and the seemingly endless source of information on very specific problems, this thesis and especially the implementation would not exist in this form.
