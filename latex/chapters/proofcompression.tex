\chapter*{Proofs}

Proofs are the central object of this work.
In this chapter we define the resolution calculus, which is extended to reason about equality in Section \ref{sec:calculus}.
We define what a proof in this calculus is, define measures of proofs and what it means to process a proof.
Our methods are stated so they compress resolution proofs.
However, both methods are in their cores not dependent on the underlying proof system.
The length compression method (Chapter \ref{ch:congruence}) just requires some way to express congruence closure in a systematic way and the space compression method (Chapter \ref{ch:pebbling}) could be applied to any proof system that produces proofs that can be represented as rooted directed acyclic graphs.
Therefore, with only little extra effort the compression methods can be generalized to compress other kinds of proofs, like for example proofs in the sequent calculus.
